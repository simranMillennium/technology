The AWS Snowball service allows the transfer of huge amounts of data from the onsite data Storage location to 
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
The transfer speed is significantly faster than internet speeds and saves us time and money.

Snowball provides an interface that allows us to create jobs, track data, and track the status of our jobs
from start till finish.
