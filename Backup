AWS Backup is a backup service that makes it easy to automate, and control the backup of data across AWS services in the cloud, 
and on premises.
Using AWS Backup, we can define backup policies and monitor backup activity for your AWS resources.
AWS Backup automates backup tasks and removes the need to create scripts and manual processes.
With just a few clicks on the AWS Backup console, you can create backup policies that automate backup.
