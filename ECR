Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is an AWS managed Docker registry service which is secure, scalable,
and reliable.

Amazon ECR supports private Docker repositories and uses AWS IAM to give resource-bound permissions.
Due to this, only specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can have access to repositories and images. 
It also is integrated with Docker CLI to push, pull, and manage images.
