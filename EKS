Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is an AWS managed service that allows us to run our own Kubernetes engine on AWS
Hence, it eliminates the need to set up our own Kubernetes panel.

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Amazon EKS runs Kubernetes control plane instances across multiple Zones to ensure high availability.
Amazon EKS automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, and it provides automated version upgrades 
and patching for them.
Thus, it saves a lot of engineering time.
