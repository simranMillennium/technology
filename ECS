Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it
easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. We can host our cluster on a server-less infrastructure that
is managed by Amazon ECS by launching our services or tasks.

For more control, we can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances
that can be managed by using the EC2 launch type.
Amazon ECS lets us launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls.
It also allows us to get the state of our cluster from a centralized service, and gives us access to many
familiar AmazonEC2 features.
