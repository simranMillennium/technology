Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) gives adaptable computing capacity within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud.
In simpler terms, it means we rent a powerful computer which exists on a cloud. 
Amazon EC2 allows us to not to invest in hardware upfront. Thus, enabling us to create applications faster.

Elastic stands for flexibility. It means we can scale up or scale down as per our requirements. 
Compute stands for a computer, which exists in a cloud. 
Cloud stands for a group of servers connected with other servers through internet.

Even though it’s a public cloud, it’s a secure and reliable platform.
